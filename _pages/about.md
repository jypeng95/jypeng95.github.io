I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE)](https://dmse.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Rafael GÃ³mez-Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. from MIT DMSE in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yang Shao-Horn](https://www.rle.mit.edu/eel/). Before MIT, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Applied Physics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2017.

During my Ph.D., I developed **physics-driven guiding principles (i.e., descriptors) to design new catalysts for clean energy technologies** that reduce carbon emissions, generate renewable electricity, and produce green chemicals and fuels. I combined various experimental techniques with first-principles simulations to uncover key material parameters governing the [catalytic activity](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-022-01199-0) and [intrinsic stability](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c01233) of transitional metal compounds, revealing physical rules underlying catalytic performance and highlighting unexplored directions for catalyst optimization.

For my postdoc, I focus on **physics-informed, data-driven materials design and optimization for sustainability and decarbonization**. Specifically, I am interested in [coupling the descriptor-centered approach with machine learning and high-throughput atomistic simulations](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41578-022-00466-5) to elucidate multi-dimensional materials design principles, predict key reaction energetics/dynamics, and accelerate catalyst discovery with co-optimized activity and stability.
