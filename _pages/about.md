I am an incoming Assistant Professor (starting Jan. 2025) in the [Department of Materials Design and Innovation](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/materials-design-innovation.html) at the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Materials Science and Engineering](https://dmse.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) with Prof. Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli. I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from MIT in 2022, advised by Prof. Yang Shao-Horn. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Applied Physics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2017.

My prior work has led to early-career awards and recognitions, such as the [Graduate Student Award](https://www.mrs.org/careers-advancement/awards/spring-awards/graduate-student-awards/past-recipients) from the Materials Research Society and the [IUPAC-Zhejiang NHU International Award for Advancements in Green Chemistry for Young Chemists](https://iupac.org/awardees-of-the-2023-iupac-zhejiang-nhu-international-award-for-advancements-in-green-chemistry/) from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.

My research group will center on understanding and resolving the formidable structural, compositional, and mechanistic complexities of materials and interfaces under harsh electrochemical reaction conditions. We will build physics-based and data-driven machine-learning methods that inherently capture the fundamental laws of materials thermodynamics and surface kinetics from atomistic simulations and electrochemistry. Through this research program, we aim to empower all members to collectively construct AI-facilitated, materials-centric solutions to combat the most recalcitrant societal challenges in sustainability and decarbonization.
